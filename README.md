Election-Audit Summary:
With some slight modifications this script can be used to analyze election results for different political offices and regions. The script could be modified so that it zooms in to examine specific neighborhoods or areas rather than looking at entire counties. It may be beneficial to alter the script so that it does not display "outlier" candidates who earned less than 1% of the vote. The script could be made to compare voter turnout numbers and their percentage per county against results from previous elections. The modified script could potentially be used to estimate future turnout numbers and how the votes will be distributed between the counties.
